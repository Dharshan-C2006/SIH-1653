## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

Develop a virtual boardroom environment through virtual reality (VR) or sophisticated video conferencing software. This way, the candidate and interviewers can communicate in a virtual setting as if they were physically present, adding to the authenticity.
Dynamic Question Bank:

Create a database of standardized, pre-tested questions for each category of expertise areas, levels of candidates, and types of interviews (initial screen, in-depth, etc.). Questions can also be updated routinely with reference to industry trends as well as user feedback from the past interviews.
Apply an artificial intelligence-based question selection algorithm against the candidate profile so that interview questions are apt and diverse.

Scoring and Evaluation Framework:
Develop a system of dual evaluation scores for the interviewers as well as candidates:
Interviewer Score: Measures the relevancy and depth of questions being asked. This may be based on parameters like clarity, interest, and technical relevance.
Candidate Score: Measures the relevancy and quality of candidate answers to the questions being asked, with emphasis on subject matter knowledge, problem-solving ability, and communication effectiveness.
Real-time Feedback Mechanism:

Give immediate feedback to interviewers and candidates during and after the interview through automated scoring algorithms. The feedback can identify areas of strength and areas for improvement for both sides, encouraging ongoing learning.
Use a post-interview candidate evaluation form to have candidates review the interviewing process so that both sides review the interaction.
Interactive Simulation for Ice-Breakers and In-Depth Questions

Begin interviews with ice-breaking situations or brief exercises to relax candidates into the process and make them at ease. This may involve situational role plays or simple problem-solving exercises.
Gradually move towards more intricate techno-managerial questions related to the candidate's experience and the requirements of the job so that the interview flows smoothly.
Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard:

Develop an interviewer dashboard showing candidate scores, question performance metrics, and historical trends, allowing refining interviewing processes and objectivity.
Identify general areas where candidates tend to excel or perform poorly and help RAC adapt training or support materials accordingly.
